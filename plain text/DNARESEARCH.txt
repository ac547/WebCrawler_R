While special attention is paid to comparative genomic analysis among clinical relevant isolates, in this study we performed an exhaustive comparative analysis of enterococcal genomes of food origin and/or with potential to be used as probiotics. Beyond common genetic features, we especially aimed to identify those that are specific to enterococcal strains isolated from a certain food-related source as well as features present in a species-specific manner. Thus, the genome sequences of 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, were examined and compared. Their phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed based on orthologous proteins and whole genomes. Likewise, markers associated with a successful colonization (bacteriocin genes and genomic islands) and genome plasticity (phages and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) were investigated for lifestyle specific genetic features. At the same time, a search for antibiotic resistance genes was carried out, since they are of big concern in the food industry. Finally, it was possible to locate 1617 FIGfam families as a core proteome universally present among the genera and to determine that most of the accessory genes code for hypothetical proteins, providing reasonable hints to support their functional characterization."

High genomic plasticity allows its adaptation to changing host environments. Complete genomes of H. pylori clinical isolate UM032 and its mice-adapted serial derivatives 298 and 299, generated using both PacBio RS and Illumina MiSeq sequencing technologies, were compared to identify novel elements responsible for host-adaptation. The acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele, which encodes for a galactosyltransferase, was identified in the mice-adapted strains. Our analysis implies a new ß-1,4-galactosyltransferase role for this enzyme, essential for Ley antigen expression. Intragenomic recombination between babA and babB genes was also observed. Further, we expanded on the list of candidate genes whose expression patterns have been mediated by upstream homopolymer-length alterations to facilitate host adaption. Importantly, greater than four-fold reduction of mRNA levels was demonstrated in five genes. Among the down-regulated genes, three encode for outer membrane proteins, including BabA, BabB and HopD. As expected, a substantial reduction in BabA protein abundance was detected in mice-adapted strains 298 and 299 via Western analysis. Our results suggest that the expression of Ley antigen and reduced outer membrane protein expressions may facilitate H. pylori colonisation of mouse gastric epithelium."

Given their mutagenic potential, host-genomes have evolved epigenetic defense mechanisms to limit their expansion. In fungi, epigenetic modifications have been widely studied in ascomycetes, although we lack a global picture of the epigenetic landscape in basidiomycetes. In this study, we analysed the genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional patterns of the white-rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus throughout its life cycle. Our results performed by using high-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that strain-specific DNA methylation profiles are primarily involved in the repression of transposon activity and suggest that 21 nt small RNAs play a key role in transposon silencing. Furthermore, we provide evidence that transposon-associated DNA methylation, but not sRNA production, is directly involved in the silencing of genes surrounded by transposons. Remarkably, we found that nucleus-specific methylation levels varied in dikaryotic strains sharing identical genetic complement but different subculture conditions. Finally, we identified key genes activated in the fruiting process through the comparative analysis of transcriptomes. This study provides an integrated picture of epigenetic defense mechanisms leading to the transcriptional silencing of transposons and surrounding genes in basidiomycetes. Moreover, our findings suggest that transcriptional but not methylation reprogramming triggers fruitbody development in P. ostreatus."

Sea buckthorn is an excellent material for fruit ripening studies due to its dramatic ripening process and high contents of nutritional and anti-oxidant compounds in berries. Here, the whole transcriptome of sea buckthorn fruit at three development stages were analysed using multiple high-throughput sequencings. We assembled and annotated 9,008 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in sea buckthorn fruits, and identified 118 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 32 differentially expressed microRNAs in fruit developmental process. In addition, we predicted 1,061 cis-regulated and 782 trans-regulated targets of DE-lncRNAs, and these DE-lncRNAs are specifically enriched in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid, carotenoids and flavonoids. Moreover, the silencing of two lncRNAs (LNC1 and LNC2) in vivo and expression analysis revealed that LNC1 and LNC2 can act as endogenous target mimics of miR156a and miR828a to reduce SPL9 and induce MYB114 expression, respectively, which lead to increased and decreased anthocyanin content as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Our results present the first global functional analysis of lncRNA in sea buckthorn and provide two essential regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, which provides new insights into the regulation of fruit quality."

Prior to the CIS reaction, a target blunt-end DNA was 3' G-tailed by MMLV-RT in the presence of a tailing enhancer, deoxycytidine. In the CIS reaction, the G-tail reacted with a single-stranded DNA carrying a stretch of Cs on its 3' end (termed as GAO for guide adaptor oligonucleotide), and MMLV-RT performed DNA polymerization, starting from the 3' overhang, using the GAO as a template. We could append a given nucleotide sequence of as long as 72 nucleotides, which would be sufficient for various NGS-sequencing platforms. The high efficiency and the unique features of this MMLV-RT activity that enables the labelling of each DNA molecule with a unique degenerate sequence as a molecular identifier has many potential uses in biotechnology."

There are currently >20 regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) that have been identified in the model strain Prochlorococcus MED4. While most of these sRNAs are ecotype-specific, sRNA homologs of Yfr1 and of the Yfr2 family are widely found throughout the cyanobacterial phylum. Although they were identified 13<U+2009>yrs ago, the functions of Yfr1 and Yfr2 have remained unknown. We observed a strong induction of two Yfr2 sRNA homologs of Prochlorococcus MED4 during high light stress and nitrogen starvation. Several Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus yfr2 promoter regions contain a conserved motif we named CGRE1 (cyanobacterial GntR family transcriptional regulator responsive element 1). Using the conserved promoter region as bait in a DNA affinity pull-down assay we identified the GntR family transcriptional regulator PMM1637 as a binding partner. Similar to Yfr2, homologs of PMM1637 are universally and exclusively found in cyanobacteria. We suggest that PMM1637 governs the induction of gene expression of Yfr2 homologs containing CGRE1 in their promoters under nitrogen-depleted and high-light stress conditions."

However, the NCRs show poor conservation across species, making their function and evolution elusive. Identification and functional characterization of NCRs across species would be critical for addressing these questions. To this end, we devised a computational pipeline and performed de novo assembly and annotation of mtDNA from 19 Caenorhabditis species using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The mtDNAs for 14 out of the 19 species are reported for the first time. Comparison of the 19 genomes reveals species-specific sampling of partial displacement-loop (D-loop) sequence as a novel NCR inserted into a unique tRNA cluster, suggesting an important role of the D-loop and the tRNA cluster in shaping NCR evolution. Intriguingly, RNA-Seq analysis suggests that a novel NCR resulting from a recent duplication of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) could be utilized as a 3' UTR for up-regulation of its upstream gene. The expression analysis shows a species- and sex-specific expression of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA and nucleus, respectively. Our analyses provide important insights into the function and evolution of mitochondrial NCRs and pave the way for further studying the function and evolution of mitochondrial genome."

However, the molecular genetic basis of terpene biosynthesis pathways is virtually unknown. In this study, approximately 4<U+2009>Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of S. guaranitica leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 32 million, comprising 186 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. A total of 61,400 unigenes were assembled de novo and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified 267 unigenes that are putatively involved in terpenoid metabolism (including, 198 mevalonate and methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes and 69 terpene synthases genes). Moreover, three terpene synthase genes were studied for their functions in terpenoid biosynthesis by using transgenic Arabidopsis; most transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing these terpene synthetic genes produced increased amounts of terpenoids compared with wild-type control. The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich blue anise sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. guaranitica."

In the absence of validated datasets and despite showing extreme sensitivity to aDNA quality, these methods have been used in many published studies, sometimes with additions of arbitrary filters or modifications, designed to overcome aDNA degradation and contamination problems. The general lack of best practices for aDNA mutation calling may lead to inaccurate results. To address these problems, we present ARIADNA (ARtificial Intelligence for Ancient DNA), a novel approach based on machine learning techniques, using specific aDNA characteristics as features to yield improved mutation calls. In our comparisons of variant callers across several ancient genomes, ARIADNA consistently detected higher-quality genome variants with fast runtimes, while reducing the false positive rate compared with other approaches."
